    <h3>Our Passion</h3>
    <p>We believe in making good bread. 
       As we’ve grown, so has our menu and our community, yet our values have stayed the same.
       We take the time to make our bread, pastries, cakes, breakfasts and lunches as we always have – with care, by hand and according to the season – so that we don’t need to compromise on what we eat, whether we’re on the go, or taking time out in one of our bakeries.
       Everyone is welcome in our bakeries. 
       We believe in the power of community, in helping those around us and living as sustainably as possible. 
       We insist on the finest ingredients, supporting small businesses wherever we can, and though we’re always innovating, our baking is based on time-honoured techniques and our decades-old starters. 
       Nothing gives us as much pleasure as a freshly baked, lovingly crafted loaf.</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We bake fresh, handmade bread, pastries and cakes every day, served with our carefully-sourced house blend speciality coffee. 
       We take great pleasure in using the best ingredients we can find for food and drink, using seasonal ingredients from suppliers we trust.
       Though we’ve grown over the years, our philosophy has remained the same: to make good food that people love, and create bakeries that people want to keep coming back to. 
       Second, only to the love for our mother doughs, we take the most joy from daily chats with our regular customers, many of whom have been with us since we started.
       We hope you’ll join us soon..</p>
